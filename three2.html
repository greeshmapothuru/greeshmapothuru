       The game of Hockey has been around from the time of early civilization. Some of the reports find the earliest origin of the game 4000 years back.   
       Field hockey was reportedly played even before the birth of Christ. Basically known as the “ball and stick” game, it was played since ancient times
       in places diverse as Rome, Scotland, Egypt and South America. The game was referred to in different names but the basic idea of playing the game was the same.
       The most apt used term was “Hockie” by the Irish. Though the term was coined centuries ago, the word found its way through to the present generation.<br><br><br>
       <i>The game of ice hockey probably evolved from the game of field hockey that was played in Northern Europe for hundreds of years. The modern version of ice-hockey
       finds its origins in the rules laid down by a Canadian named J G Creighton. His rules were implemented in the first game of ice hockey played in Montreal, Canada in the year 1875.</i>

        <h3 id="h3"><li>History of STICK HOCKEY</li></h3></ul>
        <p id="p">The hockey stick was introduced in the early 1800s. The first stick was created of wood with a flat blade.
             In the 1920s, hockey players began to tape their sticks to increase the hold and strengthen the blade. The banana curve
              or the bend in the blade which we see today was developed during the phase between the years 1957-1980. A certain player named 
              Bobby Hull broke a stick at a practice match and began to play around with the “bent” stick and found to his amazement that 
               was far more accuracy in his shots. In the early 1980s, the sticks were formed of metals.</p>

         <h3 id="h3"><li>Olympic Hockey History</li></h3></ul>
         <p id="p">The first year that Hockey was played in the Olympics was in the year 1908. Only men were permitted
             to play the game. It was only in the year 1980, that women got the opportunity to play Hockey in the Olympics. 
             Ice hockey was played in early April of 1920 as a part of the Olympic Summer Games in Antwerp, Belgium.
              The tournament was also famous for being the first World Hockey Championship. Canada was the clear cut winner in the championship.
               The first Olympic Winter Games are held in Chamonix, France, in the year 1924 with Canada winning all five games.</p><br><br><br>
